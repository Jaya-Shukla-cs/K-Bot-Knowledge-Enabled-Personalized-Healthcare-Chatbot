# K-Bot Knowledge Enabled Personalized Healthcare Chatbot
###### In the present scenario when most of the things are just a click away, people consider visiting hospitals as the most effective, reliable, and convenient way for their routine check-ups or disease diagnosis. The proposed system focuses on creating an alternate using Decision Tree Algorithm where user / patient needs to register or sign in to interact with the bot just like they interact with other human beings and through a number of questions, the chatbot will recognize the other related symptoms with respect to that particular symptom provided by the user and thus, predict the disease and confidence level and the recommended specialized doctor with a link that will redirect them to the website so that they can consult the doctor and book an appointment on the basis of the reviews and ratings provided by the other users. 
##### **The main objective was to build a Health Care Domain Chat-Bot for a ‘pragmatic approach for diagnosis’ using Machine Learning and TKinter (GUI for Python).**
